# Papyrify

Glyphs.app script that turns any two-master setup into a VF with a Papyrus effect axis. Inspired by Matteo Bologna.

## Usage instructions

For a single-master font:

1. In _Font Info > Font,_ add an axis called ‘Papyrus’ (or any other arbitrary name) with tag `PAPY`
2. In _Font Info > Masters,_ set the master’s Papyrus coordinate to `0`
3. In _Font Info > Masters,_ duplicate the first master and set the coordinate of the duplicate to `100`
4. Run the script, experiment with the values, apply.
5. Export as variable font.
